The season that Donte DiVincenzo spent with the Splash Brothers helped him build the confidence to take late-game shots like the ones he hit against the Warriors Friday night, writes Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic. DiVincenzo drilled a three-pointer to tie the score with 1:48 remaining and another 80 seconds later to put the game out of reach as the Timberwolves spoiled Stephen Curry‘s return from injury. “I didn’t shoot the ball well at all tonight, but I could care less if I’m being honest with you,” DiVincenzo said. Playing with that dude over there, 30 (Curry), it just changed my mindset on my misses, my mindset on my approach. That’s the mindset I have.” As Krawczynski notes, DiVincenzo was looking for a new NBA home when he signed a one-year deal with Golden State in the summer of 2022. Joining the Warriors gave him the chance to learn from Curry and Klay Thompson, picking up their practice habits and their fearlessness about taking clutch shots. “I think it changed my entire trajectory of my career, and after that, I’ve been who I am.” There’s more on the Wolves: Another flagrant foul for Rudy Gobert any time this season will trigger an automatic suspension, according to Chris Hine of The Star-Tribune (subscription required). Gobert was whistled for flagrants in back-to-back games over the past week, putting him one flagrant-foul point away from a one-game suspension and two points away from a two-game suspension. “There was an intent to foul, but I don’t feel like it was meant to really hit him in the rib to hurt him,” Gobert said. So his screen navigation is poor, and that puts him even further behind the play.” Anthony Edwards missed Friday’s game due to soreness in his right foot and is listed as questionable for Sunday’s home matchup with Sacramento
