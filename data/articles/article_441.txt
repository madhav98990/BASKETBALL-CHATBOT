Nets’ Cam Thomas Begins On-Court Work, But Remains Out December 6th 2025 at 2:27pm CST by Rory Maher Nets guard Cam Thomas underwent an MRI earlier this week. The scan showed that his left hamstring strain is healing and he has begun on-court work, but he remains out. His status will be updated in about two weeks, the team announced today (via Twitter). Thomas sustained the hamstring strain on November 5 against Indiana. He has missed the past 14 games with the injury and is expected to miss at least four more, with Dec. 21 vs. Toronto likely being his earliest possible return date. The 24-year-old shooting guard has strained his left hamstring four different times in the past two seasons. Thomas only appeared in 25 games during the 2024/25 campaign due to the same issue. The 27th overall pick of the 2021 draft, Thomas has been a polarizing player during four years with the Nets. While he’s a talented scorer, he doesn’t contribute in many other areas. In seven healthy games this season, Thomas averaged 24.4 points, 2.9 assists and 1.6 rebounds in 31.6 minutes per contest, with a shooting line of .408/.356/.875. Brooklyn went 1-7 in games Thomas played this season and has gone 4-10 in his absence. The 5-17 Nets are currently tied for the fourth-worst record in the NBA. Thomas will be an unrestricted free agent in 2026 after signing his one-year, $6MM qualifying offer last offseason. He has the right to veto trades in ’25/26.
