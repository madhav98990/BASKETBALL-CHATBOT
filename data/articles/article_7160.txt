He fell to the wet turf and immediately grabbed his right lower leg area. That is the opposite leg from the left fibula fracture he's been dealing with throughout the past several weeks.Jones proceeded to slam his helmet to the turf multiple times before he was helped to his feet and walked gingerly to the injury tent. A few minutes later, he walked slowly to the locker room and was ruled out of the game moments later.Jones hplayed the past two games with the fractured fibula, believed to be a hairline fracture, an injury that hrestricted his mobility in losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans. He seemed to be moving more fluidly on Sunday before sustaining this latest injury, even scrambling for a first down early in the game.The injury leaves the Colts in an extremely difficult circumstance given the facial injury that has left backup and 2023 first-round choice Anthony Richardson Sr. on injured reserve. Sixth-round pick Riley Leonard, a rookie from Notre Dame, replaced Jones in the lineup, playing the first meaningful snaps of his career.The Colts and Jaguars are currently tied for the AFC South lead.
