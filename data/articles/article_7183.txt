"We will work with him on the next step of his career."Chris is a legendary Clipper who has ha historic career. I want to make one thing very clear. No one is blaming Chris for our underperformance. I accept responsibility for the record we have right now. There are a lot of reasons why we've struggled. We're grateful for the impact Chris has made on the franchise."To move on from Paul, the Clippers would have to waive him and pay out his $3.6 million salary, agree to a buyout or look to trade him, which they couldn't execute until Dec. 15.The Clippers have lost 14 of their past 16 games, including five straight, and have a 5-16 record. They lost Bradley Beal, one of their biggest offseason signings, to a season-ending hip injury in early November.Clippers coach Ty Lue was asked if Paul's departure helps the Clippers."I don't think it necessarily helped our team," Lue said before Wednesday's game. "I mean I don't think the reason why we're 5-16 is because of CP's play. I just think that it wasn't a good fit for what he was looking for. Do I want to see CP go out like this? No, I have a lot of respect for him. He's been a friend of mine over the years and you don't want to see a great go out like this. But I'm pretty sure he will find something because he's a great player. [But] I didn't want to see it end like this."Paul hrejoined the Clippers in late July on a one-year deal. For Paul, 40, this was a chance to return home and finish his career with the franchise he spent six seasons with, from 2011 to 2017. Sources told ESPN's Shams Charania last month that Paul is retiring at the end of this season, his 21st year in the NBA.Paul is the Clippers' franchise leader in total assists and steals per game. After he started 1,314 of 1,354 career games, including all 82 games last season for the San Antonio Spurs, Paul's role was to come off the bench with the Clippers, understanding he might not play every night.He hplayed in 16 games, averaging 2.9 points and 3.3 assists in 14.3 minutes. He played 15 minutes and height points and three assists in his final game with the Clippers during Monday's 140-123 loss in Miami.This is the second time the Clippers have ha difficult and abrupt ending with one of their all-time star players from the Lob City era. In July 2017, Blake Griffin signed a five-year, $171 million deal with the Clippers but was traded to the Detroit Pistons in January 2018 when the team decided to go in a different direction.
