San Antonio overcame an early 16-point deficit as Wembanyama logged his eighth game this season with 20-plus points and two-plus blocks.Devin Vassell h23 points, and Stephon Castle and De'Aaron Fox each h22 for the Spurs, marking the first time since March that the team finished with four scorers with 20-plus points, according to ESPN Research."We did it together as a team," Vassell said. I think we showed that we can guard."As San Antonio works to end a six-year postseason drought, its victory over the Thunder could prove to be a key inflection point with the Spurs seizing a meaningful win in a high-stakes matchup played in unfamiliar surroundings. The experience could prove beneficial for San Antonio down the line if it advances to the postseason, especially now that its entire roster is fully healthy."It's our first time playing [with] everybody [healthy]," Wembanyama said. But on the previous afternoon, coach Mitch Johnson scanned a practice court 150 feet behind T-Mobile Arena, where the Spurs hjust finished a full workout, before leading them into the main building through the loading docks for a light session meant mostly for photo ops.As ecstatic as San Antonio seemed about Saturday's win, it probably meant less than the sight Johnson and the staff soaked in on a sunny 72-degree Friday in Las Vegas. Wembanyama hbeen sidelined for the previous 12 games, but his return to the practice court that day marked the first time all season that the San Antonio Spurs were whole again."It's exciting," Johnson said. It's probably the most fun for the guys just to see their excitement."The win over the Thunder also marked the first time this season Wembanyama was able to compete in the same game alongside Fox, Castle and No. In a sense, the matchup against the Thunder represented a new beginning for the Spurs.San Antonio started the second half against the Thunder on a 10-0 run jump-started by a Castle 25-footer.Then, early in the fourth quarter, Wembanyama dazzled fans inside T-Mobile Center while going head-to-hewith rival Chet Holmgren. The Thunder big man attempted a midrange shot that Wembanyama swatted back in his face. On the other end, Wembanyama drained a 12-footer over Holmgren."It felt good," Castle said. I think it was a big part of why we won the game, especially how he played in the second half."Wembanyama poured in 17 of his 22 points in the second half, including a free throw with 6.1 seconds left that gave the Spurs a 109-106 edge.Wembanyama initially suffered his strained left calf in San Antonio's second NBA Cup game, and the organization took a conservative approach to bringing him back.Wembanyama's teammates responded by rolling to a record of 9-3 in his absence."Almost every night they have proven to me that I have nothing to worry about," Wembanyama said
