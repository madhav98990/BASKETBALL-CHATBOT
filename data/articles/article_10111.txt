HBane known what their research found, it would have validated his confidence that things would turn around.Using NBA data derived from camera tracking covering all shots off passes from 2016 through 2024, Alamar and Oliver discovered that experience together ha far greater impact than believed by conventional wisdom.That helps explain why Bane and several of last summer's most important players to change teams, including Cam Johnson of the Denver Nuggets and Myles Turner of the Milwaukee Bucks, got off to slow shooting starts before rediscovering their usual form. But that curve was especially challenging for new teammates, who started out shooting about 10% worse on the same shot quality than the mark they reached after 200 combined catch-and-shoots during the same season (a high bar that just 79 duos reached during the 2024-25 regular season, per GeniusIQ tracking). Orlando sent four first-round picks and a swap to the Memphis Grizzlies for Bane, and the Bucks created cap space to sign Turner by waiving Damian Lillard and stretching the remaining $110-plus million on Lillard's contract.Bane and Turner (a career 36% 3-point shooter who shot 40% last season) were in the NBA's bottom 15 in 3-point percentage among players with at least 25 attempts in October. Johnson, acquired by Denver from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Michael Porter Jr. The 53 NBA players who changed teams during the offseason and hplayed at least 15 games through Sunday collectively shot just 27% from 3-point range during their debuts and were at 33% through four games before regressing to the mean.We've seen that happen rapidly for Johnson and Turner, now shooting 41% and 39% beyond the arc, respectively. However, the rest of Bane's game has picked up after a sluggish start: He has averaged 22.5 PPG, 5.2 APG and 5.0 RPG over the past 13 games as the Magic have gone 10-3. Lo and behold, point guards who changed teams over the summer have ha difficult start to the season.Chris Paul and D'Angelo Russell have both been out of their teams' rotations at times, and Bane's teammate Tyus Jones, Dennis Schroder and Anfernee Simons have seen their roles limited. Only Jrue Holiday of the Portland Trail Blazers has excelled as a full-time starting point guard on a new team. The Atlanta Hawks' Nickeil Alexander-Walker and the Sacramento Kings' Russell Westbrook have hsuccess as combo guards.Multiple effects of familiarityMy favorite part of the research by Alamar and Oliver is the way it neatly helps explain multiple elements of NBA received wisdom. NBA executives have long been skeptical of championship contenders making major trades midseason, and this research underscores that wariness.A short-term drop-off is no reason to avoid trading for, say, Luka Doncic at the deadline, given the benefits of adding a superstar in his prime. However, it might explain why the Phoenix Suns disappointed after dealing for Kevin Durant at the 2023 trade deadline and becoming the favorite to win the Western Conference -- exacerbated by Durant playing just eight regular-season games after the deal due to injuries. Or why Doncic and Kyrie Irving didn't click until their first full season together, which ended in the NBA Finals.Players like Bane, who start the season with new teams, have plenty of runway to build up chemistry with their new teammates. The Magic are surely glthey were patient with Bane.
