Losing is where you find growth and where you really get better."The Thunder, who htheir preferred starting lineup available for the first time since their Game 7 win in June's NBA Finals, hmatched the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors' record for the best 25-game start in NBA history by going 24-1 with a plus-17.4 average point differential."What are we, 24-2?" Thunder forward Jalen Williams said. But the Spurs rallied to within three points by halftime and took the lewith a 10-0 run in the third quarter."We got off to a decent start, but they won the last three quarters," Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. It's hard to win a game, or at least control a game, when that's the case."The return of Spurs big man Victor Wembanyama, who sat out the first quarter due to his minutes restriction after missing the previous 12 games with a left calf strain, was the primary factor in San Antonio turning this one around.Wembanyama was a dominant force on both ends of the floor in his 21 minutes, finishing with 22 points, 9 rebounds and 2 blocks. The Spurs outscored the Thunder by 21 points with Wembanyama in the game."He's just a mismatch for everybody. That one possession, I knocked the ball away once and then hit it when on the way up, and he still found a way to make the shot," Thunder guard Alex Caruso said, referring to the bucket that gave the Spurs the lefor good with 2:32 remaining in the contest. "Just a great player, and he's going to keep getting better too."The Thunder ha chance to send the game into overtime in the final second, but Caruso wasn't able to make what would have been a miraculous tip-in of Williams' intentionally missed free throw. No one wants to hear that, to be honest with you."Oklahoma City power forward/center Chet Holmgren described the team as "eager and excited" to watch the film from the loss and figure out how to address flaws that were exposed by the Spurs.The Thunder felt their offense became too stagnant, especially against an elite rim protector in Wembanyama. Gilgeous-Alexander, who scored a game-high 29 points but committed a season-high five turnovers, accepted much of the fault for that."We can't be spoiled," Gilgeous-Alexander said
