When he landed, it appeared his left knee buckled, and he lay on the floor for a stretch of time before being assisted.The Magic said Wagner will undergo an MRI upon returning to Orlando on Sunday evening.It has been a season of starts and restarts for the promising Magic, who just got last season's leading scorer, Paolo Banchero, back from a left groin strain. Banchero missed 10 games during the stretch.Wagner was one of the Magic players who picked up the scoring slack. He has been averaging 25.1 points with six rebounds and four assists during the past seven games, and he leads the Magic in scoring (23.4 ppg).
