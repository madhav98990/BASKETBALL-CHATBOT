Open Extended Reactions Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has been ruled out for Sunday's rogame against the Utah Jazz because of left elbow bursitis. Gilgeous-Alexander will miss his first game of the season for the 22-1 Thunder. The reigning MVP is averaging 32.8 points, 6.4 assists and 4.7 rebounds per game and is coming off a 33-point performance in a win over the Dallas Mavericks on Friday in which he played only three quarters. Gilgeous-Alexander has scored at least 20 points in 95 straight games, the second-longest such streak in NBA history behind Wilt Chamberlain's 126 straight from 1961 to 1963. The Thunder have two days off after facing the Jazz, then host the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.
